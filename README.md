# Quantifying Meibomian Gland Morphology Using Artificial Intelligence

This released repository implements [Quantifying Meibomian Gland Morphology Using Artificial Intelligence](https://journals.lww.com/optvissci/Abstract/2021/09000/Quantifying_Meibomian_Gland_Morphology_Using.15.aspx). More specifically, the gland segmentation of meibography images.

## Requirements
- minoconda3
- pytorch==1.11.0 
- torchvision==0.12.0
- use pip install if you miss any dependencies

## Data and the Trained model
We are not releasing the training data at this moment. However we are providing a sample set that you can run and validate results. See sample set [here](./sample_data).

To download the trained model, please fill [this form](https://forms.gle/JnzUgCWG34E71rK8A).

## Cutomized for your own data
If you want to work on your own data, change `data_path` and `raw_dir` in [create_annotations.py](./data/scripts/create_annotations.py) accordingly. 

Then, run the following:
```
python data/scripts/create_annotations.py
```

## Training
Run the following:
```
cd code
python train.py --dataset meibo --gpu YOUR_GPU_NUMBER
```

## Evaluation
Run the following:
```
cd code
python pred_list.py --lst val.lst --usegpu --dataset meibo --model PATH_TO_YOUR_MODEL
```
See some sample visualization results [here](./sample_results/).
